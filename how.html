<h1><a>How?</a></h1>
<p>
  We have a <strong>3-step approach</strong> to getting your idea(s) tested
  in the hands of <em>real</em> people.

  <li>
    <i>Understand</i> the problem that needs to be solved
    and confirm the intended users feel the <i>pain</i>
    and <i>need</i> for a solution.
  </li>
  <li>
    <em>Prototype</em> the solution and get feedback from
    <i>real</i> people as fast as possible.
  </li>
  <li>
    <em>Review</em> customer feedback and <i>confirm</i> we are
    making progress toward solving the problem.
