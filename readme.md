# *Welcome* to the dwyl website!

Currently just a landing page some people have a way of getting in touch with us!

## How?

To run this site on your localhost, simply ***install*** the *dependencies* from npm and then ***start*** it:

```sh
npm install && npm start
```

Then visit: http://localhost:3000


## Background

We are migrating from using GitHub Pages to using a little ***Open Source CMS***
we are building: [***adoro***](https://github.com/dwyl/adoro)

The *reason* we (*think we*) have out-grown GitHub pages is we don't want to force people
to type urls with the `.html` ...
