# *Welcome* to the dwyl website!

Currently just a landing page some people have a way of getting in touch with us!

We are migrating from using GitHub Pages to using a little ***Open Source CMS***
we are building: [***adoro***](https://github.com/dwyl/adoro)

The *reason* we have out-grown GitHub pages is we don't want to force people
to type urls with the `.html` ...
